/** This is the base class of the CellmlAdapter, that handles common functionality.
 * nStates: number of states in one instance of the CellML problem
 * 
 *  Naming:
 *   Intermediate (opendihu) = KNOWN (OpenCMISS) = Algebraic (OpenCOR)
 *   Parameter (opendihu, OpenCMISS) = KNOWN (OpenCMISS), in OpenCOR also algebraic
 *   Constant - these are constants that are only present in the source files
 *   State: state variable
 *   Rate: the time derivative of the state variable, i.e. the increment value in an explicit Euler stepping
