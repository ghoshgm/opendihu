        Description
        ===========
        
        While SCons is an excellent build system, I find that its configuration scheme
        is a little lacking. For packages that have complex setups, with variations
        across platforms and between versions, configuration can be a very difficult
        process. scons-config is intended to reduce the pain of locating and validating
        installed packages on a machine.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        There are two dependencies.
        
          Python 2.6 or 2.7
            Good old Python, version 2.6 or 2.7.
        
          SCons
            A ``make`` alternative. Download at "http://www.scons.org".
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Run the ``setup.py`` script as per distutils installation::
        
          sudo python setup.py install
        
        Example SConstruct
        ==================
        
        There is an example ``SConstruct`` file in ``sconsconfig``, it is intended to be
        used as a template in your projects. Hopefully it's not too obfuscated and can
        be easily understood.
        
        Available Packages
        ==================
        
        The packages available for configuration can be found under
        ``sconsconfig/packages``. They can be added to the SConstruct file in the same
        way as demonstrated in the example.
        
        Download Packages
        =================
        
        Packages can be setup to be downloaded from a source and automatically built
        according to the needs of your project. TODO: Needs documentation.
