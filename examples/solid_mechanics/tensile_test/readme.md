This example includes some different materials and computes the characteristic load curve for each.
There are two scenarios: 
* force, where an increasing force is applied and a stress-strain curve is computed
* convergence, where the same test is computed with varying number of finite elements

The tests can be run (after compiling) inside `build_release` with `../run_force.sh` and `../run_convergence.sh` and plotted by the `plot_force.py` and `plot_convergence.py` scripts.
