This directory contains a lot of input files that are used by the `electrophysiology` examples.
Because some of them are large, this directory is not part of the github repository.

It is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ssGRgDz1uQcsoWeuE6ldUAn7-SW1YkH/view?usp=sharing

```
cd $OPENDIHU_HOME/example/electrophysiology
# Manually download file from the given link, copy it to this directory.
# Extract the files using the following command, finally they should to be in the directory $OPENDIHU_HOME/example/electrophysiology/input
tar xf input.tgz
```
