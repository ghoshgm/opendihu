## Choose solver

We can choose between a dynamic or a quasistatic solver, or a linear or a non-linear solver. All in all, there are four tested solver options for this case:
- tendon_dynamic
- tendon_linear_dynamic
- tendon_quasistatic
- tendon_linear_quasistatic

Linear or non-linear is given by the material properties of the tendon and refers to the relationship between the stress (S) and the strain (E). The material parameters must be chosen accordingly in the `variables.py`file:

- linear tendon: `tendon_material= "SaintVenantKirchoff"` 
- non-linear tendon: `tendon_material= "SaintVenantKirchoff"` 

Dynamic or static (quasistatic just means we solve a static problem for each timestep) has to do with wether we neglect inertia forces or not. For large inertia forces it is necessary to use the dynamic solver. Choose configuration file accordinly:

- dynamic: `settings_tendon.py"` 
- quasistatic: `settings_tendon_quasistatic.py` 

## Bulk force and external forces

A bulk force is appled on the whole body ( eg. gravity), whereas a external force is a force applied to the surface.

The body force is included in the configuration by `"constantBodyForce": variables.constant_body_force` .

The external force is included in the configuration as a Neumann boundary condition. 

**Constant traction**

The most likely scenario is that we have a constant force pulling from one of the extremes of the tendon. This can be add in the configuration as follows:

```
"neumannBoundaryConditions":   variables.elasticity_neumann_bc,     
"divideNeumannBoundaryConditionValuesByTotalArea": False,         # if True, we divide by the area
```

where

```
k = 0 # bc at  z=0
variables.elasticity_neumann_bc = [{"element": k*mx*my + j*mx + i, "constantVector": [0.0,0.0,-1.000], "face": "2-"} for j in range(my) for i in range(mx)]

```
Please note that tendons are rather stift, so if you apply small forces (eg. < 1000) you will not see deformations with the bare eye. You see larger deformations if you use a linear solver.  TODO: what are the units for traction?

Consider the results for `n_elements_tendon = [6, 6, 4]` and `dt_elasticity = 0.1`:

| Tables        | linear        | non-linear  |
| :-------------: |:-------------| :----------|
| quasistatic   | We get F = - 986.0 |  An error message for det J < 0 appears. We can get around it by choosing `"loadFactors": [0.5, 1.0]`. We get F = - 997.0 |
| dynamic | At t=0 we get F = - 986 and at t=1.0 we get F = - 986    | An error message for det J < 0 appears. We can get around it by choosing `dt=0.01`. At t=0 we get F = - 978.5 and at t=1.0 we get F = - 997.3 |

**Increasing traction** 

A classical example to increases from 0 to x at one of the extremes of the tendon.

```
"neumannBoundaryConditions":   variables.elasticity_neumann_bc,     
"divideNeumannBoundaryConditionValuesByTotalArea": False,         # if true we divide by the area
"updateNeumannBoundaryConditionsFunction": update_neumann_bc,       
"updateNeumannBoundaryConditionsFunctionCallInterval": 1          
```

where

```
external_force = 1000.0
k = 0 # bc at  z=0
variables.elasticity_neumann_bc = [{"element": k*mx*my + j*mx + i, "constantVector": [0,0,0.0], "face": "2-"} for j in range(my) for i in range(mx)]

def update_neumann_bc(t):
  factor = min(1, t/1)   # at t=1.0 we have F = external_force
  elasticity_neumann_bc = [{
		"element": k*mx*my + j*mx + i, 
		"constantVector": [0,0, -external_force*factor], 		# force pointing to bottom
		"face": "2-",
    "isInReferenceConfiguration": True
  } for j in range(my) for i in range(mx)]

  config = {
    "inputMeshIsGlobal": True,
    "divideNeumannBoundaryConditionValuesByTotalArea": False,            
    "neumannBoundaryConditions": elasticity_neumann_bc,
  }
  return config
```

Consider the results for `n_elements_tendon = [6, 6, 4]`. We look at the results at t=1.0

| Tables        | linear      | non-linear  |
| :-----------: |:-----------:| :----------|
| quasistatic   | F = - 886 if `dt = 0.1` and F = - 900 if `dt=0.01`|  F = - 897 if `dt = 0.1` and F = - 968 if `dt=0.01` |
| dynamic       | F = - 886 if `dt = 0.1` and F = - 974 if `dt=0.01` |  F = - 897 if `dt = 0.1` and F = - 986 if `dt=0.01` |

> **Warning**
> I was expecting the quasistatic solver to match the bc better than the dynamic, but that's not the case. However, the values show less variance for the quasistatic: eg. we have $968.6 \pm 0.2$ for the quasistatic vs $986.5 \pm 2.0$


## How to set Dirichlet BC

Here we consider different possible options for the dirichlet BC assuming that we set a neumann traction boundary condition at one end of the tendon:

- **Option 1**: 

Fix one extreme of the tendon completely -> most intuitive to me
```
k = nz-1 #free side of the tendon
for j in range(ny):
  for i in range(nx):
    variables.elasticity_dirichlet_bc[k*nx*ny + j*nx + i] = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, None, None, None]                
```

-  **Option 2**:
Fix u_z on the extreme of the tendon and fix one of the edges on the u_x and u_y direction along the tendon. 
```
k = nz-1 #free side of the tendon
for j in range(ny):
  for i in range(nx):
    variables.elasticity_dirichlet_bc[k*nx*ny + j*nx + i] = [None, None, 0.0, None, None, None] 
            
for k in range(nz):
    variables.elasticity_dirichlet_bc[k*nx*ny + j*nx][0] = 0.0   
    variables.elasticity_dirichlet_bc[k*nx*ny + j*nx][1] = 0.0                         
```

-  **Option 3**:

BM: Use *statically determined constraints* (only u_z fixed in the plane, u_x and u_y only at two edges and all three only at a corner point)

```
k = nz-1 #free side of the tendon
for j in range(ny):
  for i in range(nx):
    variables.elasticity_dirichlet_bc[k*nx*ny + j*nx + i] = [None, None, 0.0, None, None, None]       

for j in range(ny):
    variables.elasticity_dirichlet_bc[k*nx*ny + j*nx][0] = 0.0

for i in range(nx):
    variables.elasticity_dirichlet_bc[k*nx*ny  + i][1] = 0.0         
```

-  **Option 4**:

Ommit Dirichlet BC -> but then the problem is underconstraint?!


## Reproduce BM's simulation

- Choose the following parameters:

```
dt_elasticity = 0.001     
tendon_extent = [3.0, 3.0, 2.0]  //cm        
n_elements_tendon = [4, 4, 4] 
constant_body_force = None
tendon_material = "nonLinear"                 
```

> **Warning**
> Seems like `"fiberDirection": [0,0,1]` must be specified. If I change it too eg. `[0,1,0]`, results look different. Why would this make a difference?

- Initial state:

```
"initialValuesDisplacements":  [[0.0,0.0,0.0] for _ in range(nx * ny * nz)],     
"initialValuesVelocities":     [[0.0,0.0,0.0] for _ in range(nx * ny * nz)], 
```    

- Build and run:

```
mkorn && sr
./build_release/tendon_dynamic settings_tendon_bm.py
```

- Visualization in Paraview
    - u_z (representation: surface with edges)
    - T (material traction)_z (TODO:glyph?)

- Run from a user-given starting point

Define the initial values for displacement based on an input file. 

```
data = np.genfromtxt("u_1000.csv", delimiter=",")
initial_displacements = [list(x) for x in data[:,0:3]]
```

- Discussion of Results

We are solving a dynamic problem. We reach a steady state when the external forces and the internal stress field is in equilibrium. With dt = 0.001 it looks like by t=1.0 we are already in the steady state.
